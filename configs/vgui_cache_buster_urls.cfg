// URL configuration options for vgui_cache_buster.smx
// 
// Provides a list of URL prefixes and the preferred method to handle them.
// The following strings are valid values:
//  "none"          performs no processing on the URL
//  "proxy"         rewrites the transmitted URL so it's rendered within an iframe "proxy"
//  "delayed"       forces a blank page to be transmitted first, then the actual page after a delay
//
// The longest matching URL prefix takes priority.
// 
// A special wildcard URL handler, "*", is provided, which can be configured with one of the above values to set the default handler.
// If no URL prefix matches and no wildcard handler is specified, "delayed" is used by default.
